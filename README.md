# js-guitar-scales
A lightweight js webapplication to calculate guitar scales.

JS Guitar Scales is a private project I started because most guitar scale calculators relied on Flash and/or were lacking in features such as variable string count, tunings, etc.  
It is my attempt to keep it as lightweight as possible (no external frameworks or libraries), but still having all features for customizing the guitar setup and delivering the required information for the user.
